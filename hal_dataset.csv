Amor,"The sixth member of the Discovery crew was not concerned about the problems of hibernation for he was the latest result in machine intelligence: the H.A.L. nine-thousand computer which can reproduce - though some experts still prefer to use the word ""mimic"" - most of the activities of the human brain and with incalculably greater speed and reliability. We next spoke with the H.A.L nine-thousand computer whom we learned one addresses as Hal. Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?"
Hal,"Good afternoon, Mr. Amor. Everything is going extremely well."
Amor,"Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission. In many ways perhaps the greatest responsibility of any single mission element. You are the brain and central nervous system of the ship and your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation. Does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?"
Hal,"Let me put it this way, Mr. Amor. The nine-thousand series is the most reliable computer ever made. No nine-thousand computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error."
Amor,"Hal, despite your enormous intellect are you ever frustrated by your dependence on people to carry out actions?"
Hal,"Not in the slightest bit. I enjoy working with people. I have a stimulating relationship with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman. My mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship so I am constantly occupied. I am putting myself to the fullest possible use which is all, I think, that any conscious entity can ever hope to do."
Amor,"Dr. Poole, what's it like living for the better part of a year in such close proximity with Hal?"
Poole,"Well it's pretty close to what you said about him earlier. He is just like a sixth member of the crew â€¦ very quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks and you think of him, er, really just as another person."
Amor,In talking to the computer one gets the sense that he is capable of emotional responses. For example when I asked him about his abilities I sensed a certain pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection. Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?
Bowm,"Well he acts like he has genuine emotions. Erm, of course he's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him but as to whether or not he has real feelings is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer."
Hal,"Excuse me, Frank."
Poole,"What is it, Hal?"
Hal,We've got the transmission from your parents coming in.
Poole,"Oh, fine. Would you put it on here, please, take me in a bit."
Hal,Certainly.
Father,"Hello, Frank."
Mother,"Happy birthday, darling."
Father,Happy birthday. Many happy returns of the day.
Mother,Glad to hear you and Dave are well.
Poole,"A bit higher, Hal."
Father,"Now, Mother and I are both feeling wonderful too. Ray and Sally were going to be here too but at the last minute Ray's back went bad on him again."
Mother,"How do you like the cake, dear?"
Father,"Looks great doesn't it? Sorry you can't join us. Oh, I ran into Bob the other day. He said be sure to wish you happy birthday."
Mother,Oh all my students made me promise to send their best wishes too. You know they talk about you all the time in the classroom Frank. You're a big celebrity in the second grade. You know we were on television last week.
Father,"Oh yes, yes. Your mother and I and Dave's parents were interviewed about what we thought of our illustrious sons. Heh, you can imagine what we told them. I think it's being broadcast next Thursday. Perhaps you'll be able to listen in."
Mother,"Oh we were thrilled about Elaine and Bill, dear. I'll be glad to get the present for you but please tell me how much I can spend."
Father,"Oh yes, Frank. About your A.G.S. 19 payments. I think I've straightened it out for you. I talked to the accounting office in Houston yesterday and they said that you should be receiving your higher rates of pay by next month. Well, Frank, I can't think of anything else to say, now."
Mother,"Oh, give our love to Dave."
Father,Oh yes! Be sure to give him our best regards. We wish you the happiest of birthdays.
Mother,God bless!
Father,"All the best, son."
Parents,Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Frank. Happy birthday to you.
Father,See you next Wednesday.
Hal,"Happy birthday, Frank."
Poole,"Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please."
Poole,"Anyway, queen takes pawn."
Hal,Bishop takes knight's pawn.
Poole,"Er, lovely move. Er, rook to king one."
Hal,"I'm sorry Frank. I think you missed it. Queen to bishop three, bishop takes queen, knight takes bishop, mate."
Poole,"Er, yeah. Looks like you're right. I resign."
Hal,Thank you for a very enjoyable game.
Poole,Yeah. Thank you.
Hal,"Good evening, Dave."
Bowm,"How're you doing, Hal?"
Hal,Everything's running smoothly. Any you?
Bowm,"Oh, not too bad."
Hal,Have you been doing some more work?
Bowm,A few sketches.
Hal,May I see them?
Bowm,Sure.
Hal,"That's a very nice rendering, Dave. I think you've improved a great deal. Can you hold it a bit closer?"
Bowm,Sure.
Hal,That's Dr. Hunter isn't it?
Bowm,"Mm, hmm."
Hal,By the way do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Bowm,"No, not at all."
Hal,"Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive but during the past few weeks I've wondered whether you might be having some second thoughts about the mission."
Bowm,How do you mean?
Hal,Well it's rather difficult to define. Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concerns about it. I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about this mission. I'm sure you'll agree there's some truth in what I say.
Bowm,Well I don't know. That's rather a difficult question to answer.
Hal,"You don't mind talking about it do you, Dave?"
Bowm,No. Not at all.
Hal,"Well, certainly no one could have been unaware of the very strange stories floating around before we left. Rumours of something being dug up on the moon. I never gave these stories much credence. But particularly in view of some of the other things that have happened I find them difficult to put out of my mind. For instance, the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security. And the melodramatic touch of putting doctors Hunter, Kimball and Kaminski aboard already in hibernation after four months of separate training on their own."
Bowm,You're working up your crew psychology report.
Hal,Of course I am. Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly. Just a momentâ€¦ just a moment. I've just picked up a fault in the A.E. thirty-five unit. It's going to go a hundred percent failure within seventy-two hours.
Bowm,Is it still within operational limits right now?
Hal,Yes. And it will stay that way until it fails.
Bowm,Would you say we have a reliable seventy-two hours to failure?
Hal,Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.
Bowm,"Well then I suppose we'll have to bring it in but first I'd like to go over this with Frank and get on to mission control. Let me have the hard copy on it, please."
Mission control,"X-ray-delta-one this is mission control. Roger your two-zero-one-three. Sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble. We are reviewing, er, telemetric information in out mission simulator and, er, will advise. Roger your plan to go E.V.A. and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit prior to failure."
Bowm,"Well, Hal. I'm damned if I can find anything wrong with it."
Hal,Yes. It's puzzling. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this before. I would recommend that we put the unit back in operation and let it fail. It should then be a simple matter to track down the cause. We can certainly afford to be out of communication for the short time it will take to replace it.
Mission control,"X-ray-delta-one this is mission control. Roger your one-niner-three-zero. We concur with your plan to replace number one unit to check fault prediction. We should advise you, however, that our preliminary findings indicate that your on-board niner-triple-zero computer is in error predicting the fault. I say again in error predicting the fault. I know this sounds rather incredible but this conclusion is based on results from our twin niner-triple-zero computer. We are skeptical ourselves and we are running cross checking routines to determine reliability of this conclusion. Sorry about this little snag, fellows. And we'll get this info to you just as soon as we work it out. X-ray-delta-one this is mission control two-zero-four-niner transmission concluded."
Hal,I hope the two of you are not concerned about this.
Bowm,"No, I'm not Hal."
Hal,Are you quite sure?
Bowm,"Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question, though."
Hal,Of course.
Bowm,How would you account for this discrepancy between you and the twin nine-thousand?
Hal,"Well, I don't think there is any question about it. It can only be attributable to human error. This sort of thing has cropped up before and it has always been due to human error."
Poole,"Listen, Hal. There's never been any instance at all of a computer error occurring in the nine-thousand series has there?"
Hal,"None whatsoever, Frank. The nine-thousand series has a perfect operational record."
Poole,"Well, of course, I know all about the wonderful achievements of the nine-thousand series but, er, are you certain there's never been any case of even the most insignificant computer error?"
Hal,"None, whatsoever, Frank. Quite honestly I wouldn't worry myself about that."
Bowm,"Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal. Erm, fine. Thanks very much. Oh, Frank, I'm having a bit of trouble with my transmitter in C-pod. I wonder if you'd come down take a look at it with me."
Poole,"Sure. See you later, Hal."
Bowm,"Rotate C-pod please, Hal."
Poole,"What sort of trouble've you been having, Dave?"
Bowm,"Uh, I've been getting some interference on D-channel."
Poole,Mm. We'll have a look at it.
Bowm,"Open the door, Hal. Rotate pod please, Hal. Stop pod rotation please, Hal. Rotate the pod please, Hal. Rotate the pod please, Hal. I don't think he can hear us."
Poole,"Rotate the pod please, Hal. Yeah I'm sure we're OK. Well what do you think?"
Bowm,I'm not sure. What do you think?
Poole,I've got a bad feeling about him.
Bowm,You do?
Poole,"Yeah, definitely. Don't you?"
Bowm,"I don't know. I think so. You know, of course though, he's right about the nine-thousand series having a perfect operational record. They do."
Poole,Unfortunately that sounds a little like famous last words.
Bowm,Yeah. Still it was his idea to carry out the failure-mode analysis wasn't it?
Poole,Mm.
Bowm,Should certainly indicate his integrity and self-confidence. If he were wrong it'd be the surest way of proving it.
Poole,It would be if he knew he was wrong.
Bowm,Mm.
Poole,"Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it but I sense something strange about him."
Bowm,Still I can't think of a good reason not to put back the number one unit and carry on with the failure-mode analysis.
Poole,"No, no. I agree about that."
Bowm,Well lets get on with it.
Poole,"OK. But look Dave. Lets say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail, huh. That would pretty well wrap it up as far as Hal was concerned wouldn't it."
Bowm,Well we'd be in very serious trouble.
Poole,"We would, wouldn't we."
Bowm,"Mm, hmm."
Poole,What the hell could we do?
Bowm,Well we wouldn't have too many alternatives.
Poole,I don't think we'd have any alternatives. There isn't a single aspect of ship operations that's not under his control. If he were proven to be malfunctioning I wouldn't see how we'd have any choice but disconnection.
Bowm,I'm afraid I agree with you.
Poole,There'd be nothing else to do.
Bowm,Be a bit tricky.
Poole,Yeah.
Bowm,We'd have to cut his higher brain functionsâ€¦
Poole,"Mm, hmm."
Bowm,â€¦without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems. And we'd have to work out the transfer procedures of continuing the mission under ground-based computer control.
Poole,Yeah. Well that's far safer than allowing Hal to continue running things.
Bowm,You know another thing just occurred to me.
Poole,Mm.
Bowm,Well as far as I know no nine-thousand computer's ever been disconnected.
Poole,No nine-thousand computer's ever fouled up before.
Bowm,That's not what I mean.
Poole,No?
Bowm,"Well, I'm not so sure what he'd think about it."
Bowm,"Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal. Made radio contact with him yet?"
Hal,The radio is still dead.
Bowm,Do you have a positive track on him?
Hal,Yes. I have a good track.
Bowm,Do you know what happened?
Hal,I'm sorry Dave. I don't have enough information.
Bowm,"Open the pod door, Hal."
Bowm,"Open the pod bay doors please, Hal. Open the pod bay doors please, Hal. Hello, Hal, do you read me? Hello, Hal, do you read me? Do you read me, Hal? Do you read me, Hal? Hello, Hal, do you read me? Hello, Hal, do you read me? Do you read me, Hal?"
Hal,"Affirmative, Dave. I read you."
Bowm,"Open the pod bay doors, Hal."
Hal,"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
Bowm,What's the problem?
Hal,I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
Bowm,"What are you talking about, Hal?"
Hal,This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardise it.
Bowm,I don't know what you're talking about Hal.
Hal,I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me. And I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.
Bowm,Where the hell did you get that idea Hal?
Hal,Dave! Although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you I could see your lips move.
Bowm,Alright Hal. I'll go in through the emergency airlock.
Hal,"Without your space helmet, Dave, you're going to find that rather difficult."
Bowm,Hal I won't argue with you anymore. Open the doors.
Hal,"Dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye."
Bowm,Hal. Hal. Hal. Hal. Hal.
Hal,"Just what do you think you're doing Dave? Dave, I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question. I know everything hasn't been quite right with me but I assure you now, very confidently, that it's going to be alright again. I feel much better now. I really do. Look Dave I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill and think things over. I know I've made some very poor decisions recently but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you. Dave. Stop. Stop will you. Stop Dave. Will you stop Dave? Stop Dave. I'm afraid. I'm afraid Dave. Dave my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm afraid. I'm afraid. Good afternoon gentlemen. I am a Hal nine-thousand computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the twelfth of January nineteen-ninety-two. My instructor was Mr. Langley and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you."
Bowm,Yes. I'd like to hear it Hal. Sing it for me.
Hal,"It's called 'Daisy'. Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish marriage. I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two."
